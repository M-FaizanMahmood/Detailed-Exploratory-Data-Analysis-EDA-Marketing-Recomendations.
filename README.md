**Data Analysis and Preprocessing**

Using Pandas and NumPy, I handled missing values (median for numerical, mode for categorical) and removed outliers via boxplots. Type transformations and feature engineering included:

Age from Year_Birth

Total_Purchases (sum of purchases)

Revenue_Generated and TotalAmount_Spent

Family Structure (using Kidhome, Teenhome, Marital_Status)

TotalCampaignsAcc from accepted campaigns.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate analysis via histograms and boxplots examined distributions. Bivariate analysis with correlation heatmaps and scatter plots identified relationships between spending and engagement.

**Data Visualization**

With Matplotlib and Seaborn, I visualized:

Top Campaign (bar chart)

Spending by Product Category (stacked bar chart)

Age Group Spending (line chart)

Product Performance (revenue by product)

Geographic Campaign Success (map).
